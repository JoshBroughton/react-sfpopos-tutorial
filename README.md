# SFPOPOS Site Design

## User Stories

1. As an office worker in downtown San Francisco, I want to be able to see a list of all SFPOPOS at a glance, along with key details such as image, address, and hours, so that I can quickly visualize all of my options for where to visit.

2. As an office worker, a want to be able to find out more about specific spaces, so that I can refine my decision about what sites would be suitable for me to visit for a quiet lunch break, to focus on work, or to have an informal business meeting

3. As an office worker, I want to be able to visit this site from my smartphone in order to remember which sites I want to go to, their hours, and how to get to them. I want to be able to open the maps app directly from this site, so I can easilly navigate to the space.
